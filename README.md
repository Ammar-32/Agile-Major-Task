## Product Backlog Rationale
Backlog items are ordered according to their business value to the stakeholders since the stakeholders favors some items over the others due to the possible return on investment. Also concerning the small stories, if a specific story depends on another, then it should be executed after it.

### Some Notes
* Our team can achieve around 55 story points per sprint 

* Our sprint duration will be 2 weeks

* For each productive working day where the almost all the team members are working for 8 hours a day / 5 times a week, They can finish 4-6 story points.

## Convention
Convention
We will depend on the Fibonacci numbers in our estimation to decide the story points according to the following table
| Story Points      | Story Type |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| 5     | Very Small       |
| 8   | Small        |
| 13   | Medium        |
| 20   | Large        |
| 40   | Very Large        |
